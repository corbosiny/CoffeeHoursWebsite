									<h1>About Dr. Evans</h1>
								</header>
								<div class="evans_image"><center><img src="images/evans-portrait.jpg" alt="" /></center></div>
								<p>Dr. Brian L. Evans is the esteemed Engineering Foundation Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at The University of Texas at Austin. With a profound dedication to the principles of academic freedom and shared governance, he has woven a distinguished career in both teaching and research within the realm of electrical and computer engineering.</p>
								<p>Dr. Evans' impactful contributions extend beyond his academic pursuits. Having served on the Faculty Committee of Counsel on Academic Freedom and Responsibility for over a decade, including six years as its chair, he has been instrumental in enhancing processes and procedures for faculty evaluations, shaping academic policies that foster excellence.</p>
								<p>His leadership also extended to the role of Faculty Council Chair during the 2019-20 academic year. In this capacity, he deftly orchestrated faculty responses to critical challenges, orchestrating cohesive approaches to address the complexities presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, matters of racial justice, gender equity, and pivotal concerns related to compensation, working conditions, and access to mental health services for the academic community.</p>
								<p>Recognition of Dr. Evans' exceptional service arrived in the form of the prestigious University Civitatis Award in 2021. This distinction acknowledges his outstanding contributions that transcend the conventional realms of teaching and research. Notably, in collaboration with Prof. Pat Somers, he established the UT Austin chapter of the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) in Fall 2021, firmly advocating for the principles of academic freedom and shared governance.</p>
								<p>Dr. Evans' academic journey commenced with a B.S.E.E.C.S. degree from the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in 1987, followed by M.S.E.E. and Ph.D.E.E. degrees from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 1988 and 1993, respectively. A post-doctoral tenure at the University of California, Berkeley, paved the way for his esteemed position at UT Austin, where he has been a proud and influential faculty member since 1996.</p>
								<p>Presently, Dr. Evans spearheads a vibrant research group focused on advancing 5G/6G cellular communication systems operating over high-frequency millimeter wave bands. This cutting-edge endeavor encompasses the exploration of mixed analog/digital signal processing architectures and pioneering algorithms tailored for multiantenna systems. The group's audacious goal is to reduce power consumption by a factor of 1000 while optimizing communication performance. Additionally, they are harnessing the potential of machine learning to elevate various aspects of communication networks, spanning band switching and basestation coordination to 5G network fault remediation.</p>
